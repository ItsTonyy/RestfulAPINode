# Repository Name: RESTful API with TypeScript, Fastify, Prisma, and PostgreSQL
### Description:
This repository contains a robust and efficient RESTful API built using TypeScript, Fastify, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The project leverages the power of Fastify for blazing-fast server-side performance, TypeScript for type safety, and Prisma for seamless database interaction. The API is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend, making it an ideal starting point for modern web applications.

**Key Features**:
- TypeScript: Ensures type safety and improved code quality with static typing.
- Fastify: High-performance web framework for fast server-side processing and optimized request handling.
- Prisma: Modern database toolkit and ORM that simplifies database interactions with a type-safe API.
- PostgreSQL: Reliable and powerful relational database for storing and managing data.
- Zod: Schema validation and type definition library for validating request data and ensuring data integrity.
- RESTful Architecture: Adheres to REST principles for resource-oriented, stateless, and cacheable web services.
